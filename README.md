# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills and experience in **data science** and **Web and Cloud App & software development**.

## Projects

### 1. **TestGenie** (GitHub Repo: [Link](https://github.com/ZhouyayanLi/TestGenie))
- **Description**: A Gen-AI-powered record and table generator that allows users to manipulate data with natural language.
- **Technologies**: Flask, Python, Large Language Models (LLMs), HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- **Keywords**: LLMs; Natural Language Processing; Full-stack development.
- **My Role**: Created 80% of the functional modules, built the entire structure and logic, and led a team of 5 to finalize the UI and improve backend-frontend integration.
- **Deliverable**: A Web application.

### 2. **EarthObsNet** (GitHub Repo: [Link](https://github.com/ZhouyayanLi/EarthObsNet))
